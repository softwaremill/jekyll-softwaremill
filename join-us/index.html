        <div>
          We are a small, but growing softwarehouse with ~30 people working for clients in Australia, South Africa, Nigeria, England and United States.
        </div>
        <div><br/>What distinguishes us:</div>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>remote work: we all work from our homes, co-working offices or sometimes even from Bieszczady Mountains</li>
            <li>flat company structure: everyone has the same right to speak their opinions or change the way the company works, no matter if you are the boss or a developer who joined us a month ago.
              If you convince the majority to your idea, we make it happen even if the boss voted for "no"</li>
            <li>financial transparency inside the company: you will know how much each of us earns or how much we spend on various stuff</li>
            <li>paid days-off when you attend a conference</li>
            <li>company launched and led by active developers, so we understand that an SSD disc is not a whim and two large external LCD displays setup is not too much</li>
          </ul>
